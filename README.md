# Dottie's Divine Doughnuts
Dottie's Divine Doughnuts is a command line application designed to automate common tasks for the owner of a doughnut retailer, Dottie. The application should make logging customer orders more efficient, allow Dottie to edit the menu in various ways, and reveal recent purchasing trends. In order to accomplish these goals, the application should interact with an external google sheet that contains Dottie's current menu, and order history.

## UX
### User Stories:
As the business owner and sole employee (Dottie), I want to be able to:
1. Log a customer order and have the total order price calculated for me.
2. Store customer order history in an external spreadsheet.
3. Add options to the menu.
4. Remove options from the menu.
5. Edit existing option prices.
6. View some trends in recent purchases.

Additionally, any user of this application should find the UI accessibile and easy to navigate, and be able to exit the application or return to the main menu at any time.

### Flowchart:

Above is the Flowchart for this application, created using [Lucidchart](https://www.lucidchart.com).

As this application features no front-end design, I decided to not create a visual wireframe. I instead created a flowchart which details the potential pathways a user of this application may follow and explains the steps the code will have to take for the application to function as intended.
