# Dottie's Divine Doughnuts
Dottie's Divine Doughnuts is a command line application designed to automate common tasks for the owner of a doughnut retailer, Dottie. The application should make logging customer orders more efficient, allow Dottie to edit the menu in various ways, and reveal recent purchasing trends. In order to accomplish these goals, the application should interact with an external google sheet that contains Dottie's current menu, and order history.
